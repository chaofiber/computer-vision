function [outputArg1,outputArg2] = observe(particles,frame,H,W,hist_bin,hist_target,sigma_observe)
%OBSERVE compute for all particles its color histogram describing the
%bounding box defined by the center of the particle and W and H. These
%observations should be used to update the weights particle_w based on the
%chi^2 distance
